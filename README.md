# camelotinator
Camelotinator is a simple Spotify Web App designed to make your playlists DJ-friendly by rearranging the songs within them into the most optimized order for use with Spotify's crossfade feature.
The rearrangement is ordered first by the musical key of each song, then by the tempo of each song. Musical key arrangement follows the rules of the Camelot Wheel (thus the name) and tempo arrangement moves songs with the closest tempos next to one another.
